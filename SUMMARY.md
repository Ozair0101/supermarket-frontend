# Supermarket Management System - UI Redesign Summary

## Overview
We've successfully redesigned the supermarket management system UI with a modern, user-friendly admin dashboard using Tailwind CSS and a component library.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Design System
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Automatic theme switching with localStorage persistence
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components
- **Animations**: Subtle animations with Framer Motion

### 2. UI Components
- **Sidebar**: Collapsible navigation with icon support
- **Header**: Search and user profile
- **Dashboard**: Data visualization cards and charts
- **POS System**: Barcode scanning optimized for tablets
- **Data Tables**: Sortable, paginated tables with TanStack Table
- **Forms**: Validation with React Hook Form and Zod

### 3. Technologies Used
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v3.4.1
- Framer Motion for animations
- Lucide React for icons
- TanStack Table for data tables
- React Hook Form + Zod for form validation
- React Router v6 for navigation
